#Instructions

## Quick Start

1. Your code should be placed in SeleniumExample class
2. Ensure current JDK is installed (nothing else is required -- other dependencies will automatically download )
3. To run tests use: ./gradlew

## Notes

When running from Gradle -- the build script will automatically try to download required OS specific drivers for Chrome, and update requirement environment variables -- webdriver.chrome.driver

When running from an IDE -- you will need these environment variables setup and pointing to the correct webdriver
